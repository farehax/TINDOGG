                    Pit bull-type dogs have a controversial reputation as 
                    pets both in the United States and internationally, 
                    due to their history in dog fighting, the number of 
                    high-profile attacks documented in the media over decades, 
                    and their proclivity to latching on while biting. Proponents 
                    of the type and advocates of regulation have engaged in a 
                    nature-versus-nurture debate over whether apparent aggressive 
                    tendencies in pit bulls may be appropriately attributed to 
                    owners' care for the dog or inherent qualities.
